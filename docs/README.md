## Adding Deadlines & Events

You may add Deadline and Event tasks by typing the following command:
```
deadline {task name} /by {date/time}
event {task name} /from {date/time} /to {date/time}
```

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> The format of the date/time has to be in day/month/year HoursMinutes in the 24-hour time format.
> However, you may swap out the `/` for `-`, but it also has to be either all `/` or `-`!
> The day and year may be swapped too.

For instance:
```
deadline go to library /by 25/02/2025 1600
event watch a movie /from 2025-02-25 1100 /to 2025/02/25 1300

To mark/ unmark the completion of your tasks, simply type:
```
mark {task number}
unmark {task number}
```

> **TIP**
> 
> Use the `list` command to see the number of your tasks on the list!

```

> You may find all of your saved task data from the given relative path!
> 
> Note that this path is relative to the folder that the .jar file is kept in.
